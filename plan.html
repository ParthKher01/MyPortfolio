        <h1>Lifelong Learning Plan</h1> 
        <div class="intro">
            I have an IT background, and I will be looking for skills that can help 
            my personal growth and career. If I choose to learn one skill, then 
            I go with coding skill. Coding is an essential skill nowadays. 
            With the development of technology, everyone should know basic coding skills. 
            I would like to learn coding because it aligns with my academic and professional goals. 
            Coding enhances problem-solving, critical thinking, and other skills. 
            It also creates many career opportunities. 
        </div>
        <div>
            <div>
                <strong>Learning Goals:</strong> If I look at current trends, JavaScript is the first 
                choice for web developers to start their web design or development journey.

                <strong>Short Term Goals:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Currently, I have a beginner-level JavaScript knowledge, so 
                        I want expert level in JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>I enrolled in a full 
                        JavaScript course from popular platforms such as Udemy, 
                        Internshala, and Canvas, and W3School.</li>
                    <li>After that, I build a

                    <li>I solve coding problems every day on platforms such as Lit Code.</li>
                    <li>It profoundly improves my coding skills. I know Git version 
                        control so I can upload my code on that platform to manage my 
                        projects effectively.</li>
