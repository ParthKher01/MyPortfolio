                <strong>Identification of Lifelong Learning Skill:</strong>
                According to me, teamwork is working in a group to achieve the expected result or goal. 
                It involves multiple things, such as communication and coordination

                Although I like to work independently, I am also good at teamwork. 
                I understand the benefits of working in a team. But I find sometimes 
                it is a daunting task. My recent work experience at "Amazon Warehouse" added 
                valuable improvements, I improved my self by working in a team under pressure 
                and take help of team member when necessary.

                During this period, We were responsible for sorting and scanning 
                packages and ensuring that they reached the correct destinations. 
                The work was fast-paced, and success depended on seamless coordination
                among team members. We had to communicate efficiently, assist 
                each other with heavy lifting, and maintain a workflow to fulfill 
                daily targets.

                <strong>Rationale:</strong>
                
                "In conclusion, teamwork is an essential skill in both professional 
                and academic settings. My experience at Amazon Warehouse reinforced 
                the importance of collaboration in achieving shared goals, and I continue 
                to apply these skills in my business management course, where group work 
                is a key aspect of learning. Additionally, in my workplace, working 
                effectively with others is crucial for success. Developing strong 
                teamwork skills not only enhances productivity but also fosters better 
                communication and problem-solving abilities, making it an invaluable 
                asset in any career."
