                    <strong>Definition:</strong> Grit is when you try and fail but stay committed to your goal and keep pushing forward, no matter how hard it gets.
    
                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    I have good knowledge of PHP, so I can work on the Laravel framework. Recently, I was working in a team where the leader assigned tasks, including fixing bugs and errors. Some tasks were easy to solve, but others required more time and effort. Even when I struggled with more complex bugs, I stayed focused and continued solving the problems until I succeeded.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <h3><strong>Resilience</strong></h3>
            <div class="resilience">
                <p>
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> The ability to recover after failure, learn from mistakes, and try again.
    
                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    I didn’t know how to host a website on a server, so I could not view my work online. So, I decided to learn how to deploy a website. First, I watched online tutorials on YouTube and tried to follow them, but I wasn’t able to host the website correctly. 
However I did not give up, I carefully analyzed all the steps, and took the help of experts, after several attempts, I finally managed to host the website successfully.
