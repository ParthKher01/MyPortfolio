            <Strong>Self-Assessment:</Strong>

                Based on my self-assessment, I realize that I have an uncertain 
                
                mindset about my ability to develop intelligence. 
                
                I want to perform well and succeed, but I sometimes feel 
                
                discouraged by challenges and negative feedback. 
                
                I also recognize that I may not always put in the necessary 
                
                effort when faced with difficult tasks, which could limit my growth.
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <strong>Description:</strong>
        
            To address my mindset, I have created a personal growth plan 
            
            outlining steps to develop a growth mindset. This artifact includes 
            
            a self-reflection on how I currently view challenges, my reactions 
            
            to failure, and how I can improve. I have identified specific 
            
            strategies, such as embracing challenges, learning from feedback, and 
            
            focusing on effort rather than immediate success. 
            
            I wrote this reflection after completing my self-assessment, as 
            
            I wanted to document my current mindset and set goals for improvement.
        </div>

            <strong>Rationale:</strong>
        
            I chose this artifact because it represents the starting point 
            
            of my mindset journey. It provides clear evidence of self-awareness 
            
            and my commitment to personal development. Writing this reflection 
            
            helped me recognize the areas where I struggle, such as avoiding 
            
            difficult tasks or letting failure affect my confidence. By setting 
            
            specific goals and strategies for improvement, I am taking the first 
            
            step toward developing a growth mindset. This artifact demonstrates 
            
            that I am actively working on my learning attitude, which will help 
            
            me overcome obstacles and maximize my potential.
