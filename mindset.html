                    Based on my self-assessment, I realize that I have an uncertain 
                
                    mindset about my ability to develop intelligence. 
                
                    I want to perform well and succeed, but I sometimes feel 
                
                    discouraged by challenges and negative feedback. 
                
                    I also recognize that I may not always put in the necessary 
                
                    effort when faced with difficult tasks, which could limit my growth.
                    -->
                    Based on my self-assessment, I realize that I have an uncertain mindset.
                    
                    I want to perform well and succeed, but I sometimes feel discouraged 
                    
                    by challenges and negative feedback. I also recognize that I may not 
                    
                    always put in the necessary effort when faced with difficult tasks, which 
                    
                    limits my growth. However, my observation tells me that I sometimes 
                    
                    have a growth mindset. For example, while working at my current job, 
                    
                    I looking for new opportunities. Despite any doubts, I kept trying and 
                    
                    eventually secured an interview. Hence, prove that I am capable of 
                    
                    approaching challenges with a mindset geared toward growth.

            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p class="mindset"> 
                I have created a personal growth plan to develop a growth mindset. 
                My strategies include learning from feedback, accepting challenges, and 
                focusing on effort rather than immediate success.
                <div class="mindset">
                    For example, I am currently learning French and English using the 
                    Duolingo app. Sometimes I get low scores, but I always try to improve.
                    I analyze my mistakes and correct them. When I face challenges, I 
                    try different ways to solve them. I believe consistency matters more 
                    than immediate success in achieving my goal.

            <h3>Rationale:</h3>
            <p class="mindset">
                I chose this artifact because it represents the starting point 
            
                of my mindset journey. It provides clear evidence of self-awareness 
            
                and my commitment to personal development. Writing this reflection 
            
                helped me recognize the areas where I struggle, such as avoiding 
            
                difficult tasks or letting failure affect my confidence. By setting 
            
                specific goals and strategies for improvement, I am taking the first 
            
                step toward developing a growth mindset. This artifact demonstrates 
            
                that I am actively working on my learning attitude, which will help 
            
                me overcome obstacles and maximize my potential.
